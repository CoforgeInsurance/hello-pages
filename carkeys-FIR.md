Subject: Reporting the loss of both of my car keys for vehicle bearing Registration No. UP 16 EC 0638 

Respected Sir/Madam,

I, Pankaj Batra son of Baldev Raj Batra, am a resident of 41 Duplex, Swarnim Vihar, Sector 82, Noida, PIN 201304. I wish to report the unfortunate loss of my car keys for my vehicle, a Citroen Aircross (2024 Registered, 2023 manufactured) , bearing Registration Number UP 16 EC 0638 , Engine Number 10VQAE0002556, and Chassis Number MZZCGHPUSPV016379. 

The keys were lost on 10 Dec 2025 at approximately 8 PM at Sector 110 Market, Noida. Despite my best efforts to find them, I have been unsuccessful.
I then searched the second key at home and despite extensive search could not find it. In effect both keys are lost. 

I am lodging this report to prevent any potential misuse of the lost keys by unauthorized persons and to facilitate the process of obtaining a duplicate key from the service centre and an insurance claim, if applicable. 
I kindly request you to register this report and provide me with a copy of the FIR/Non-Cognizable Report (NCR) at your earliest convenience. 

Thanking you.
Yours truly,

Pankaj Batra
