            <div class="item">
                <p class="fact-text"><strong>The Term "Artificial Intelligence" Was Born at a Summer Party:</strong> The term "Artificial Intelligence" was coined in 1956 by John McCarthy at the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence. This workshop is considered the birthplace of AI as a field, where researchers gathered to discuss the possibility of creating machines that could simulate human intelligence.</p>

            <div class="item">
                <p class="fact-text"><strong>AI Can Dream Too:</strong> Google's Deep Dream project demonstrated that neural networks can generate surreal, dream-like images by over-interpreting patterns. When shown an image, the AI enhances patterns it recognizes, creating psychedelic visualizations that look like the machine is "dreaming" about what it sees.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <p class="fact-text"><strong>AI Has Mastered Ancient Games:</strong> In 2016, Google's AlphaGo defeated Lee Sedol, one of the world's top Go players, in a historic match. Go is a 2,500-year-old Chinese board game with more possible positions than there are atoms in the observable universe, making it far more complex than chess. AlphaGo's victory marked a significant milestone in AI development.</p>
